# Java 2018
  My 4 Java projects done in the summer of 2018. This is the beginning of my practice of programming with Java.
I'll continue to learn more with Java and... it's working out fine. I am new to Github, and I'm still learning how Github
works.
## Getting Started
### What's Inside?
1. A Fibonacci Sequencer with user input 
2. A Pomodoro timer with 20 minute, 10 minute and 5 minute options.
3. A very simple Calculator with a little 'fancy' instructions manual at the start of the program.
4. A Hangman Game. Without the hangman and with _ _ _ _ _ like lines.
Has checking capabilities.

### Prerequisites
The programs are lean on requirements. All you need is Java with most of its classes and methods.
Go to the [Oracle website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html), and follow the instructions to install java. 

### Installation
Install by either downloading the zip file or by using git clone:
```
git clone https://github.com/Shaedil/Java2018.git
```

## Running the programs
Because I use javac & Vim instead of any qualified IDE, you're going to have to run command prompt/terminal and run:
```
> javac Pomodoro.java
```
Or, if you are a linux/ubuntu user like me:
```
user@user1 ~ $javac Pomodoro.java
```
The javac command compiles the current java file and creates a .class file. One that can be executed using this command:
```
user@user1 ~ $java Pomodoro
```
Note that you don't have to call the '.java' extension.
Also, be sure not to copy the cash symbol as it is part of your terminal/command prompt. I learned that mistake when I first started
programming.

### This is... okay.
Sorry about that, the files in the Master branch are untouched ever since I created them. Whenever I learn new ways to make code shorter,
more effecient and easier to read, I'll start to create updated versions in a new branch called "Updated." Also, all of the java files are displayed in your command prompt/terminal.
